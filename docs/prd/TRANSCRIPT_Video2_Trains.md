### Summary of Key Strategies:

**Prerequisites:**
- Ship line already making money from Part 1
- All loans paid off
- ~$3 million in the bank to build first train lines

**Train Economics:**
- Trains are extremely expensive: ~$1.5 million each plus track costs
- Choose routes that REUSE CARS as much as possible
- Golden route: crude oil → oil → fuel chain (all tank cars for every leg)
- Wood → lumber → tools route uses some shared cars but not all

**Route Selection for Trains:**
- Look for industries that are in a LINE (not scattered)
- Forest → Saw Mill → Tools Factory → Town is ideal first train route
- All three stops should be roughly linear for efficient track layout
- Keep routes relatively straight to minimize track construction costs

**Multi-Stop Train Lines:**
- Build ONE train line with MULTIPLE stops instead of separate point-to-point lines
- Train picks up logs at forest, drops at saw mill, picks up planks, drops at tools factory, picks up tools
- This maximizes car utilization and minimizes empty runs
- Use full load at production stops, load if available at intermediate stops

**Station Design:**
- Build stations with enough platforms (2+) for passing trains
- Put stations NEAR industries but not blocking expansion
- Build depot near stations for vehicle management
- Cross-switch tracks allow trains to use any platform

**Load Settings (CRITICAL):**
- Forest stop: Full load logs (wait for full train)
- Saw Mill: Drop off logs, pick up planks (load if available, 1 min max wait)
- Tools Factory: Drop off planks, pick up tools (full load, 1 min wait)
- Town delivery: Drop everything off
- Maximum waiting time prevents trains sitting idle too long

**Vehicle Management:**
- Don't overload trains - match capacity to production
- Start with ONE train, add more only when production increases
- Don't use too many wagons - match to station length
- Tank cars for oil/fuel, gondola for ore/coal, box cars for goods/tools/food

**Financial Lessons:**
- Repay loans to see true earning rate
- Train routes take time to become profitable (~5+ game years)
- Ship income funds initial train investment
- Track total earnings per route to know what's working
- Don't build more trains until existing ones are profitable

**Key Insight - Car Reuse:**
- The biggest efficiency gain is having trains carry different cargos on different legs
- A train carrying logs one way and planks the other way = near 100% utilization
- Point-to-point routes = 50% deadhead (empty return trips)
- Multi-stop loops dramatically improve profitability
