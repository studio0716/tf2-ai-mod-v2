### Summary of Key Strategies:

**Map Selection:**
- High number of cities, low number of industries, very large map
- Ensure decent amount of water for ship routes
- Analyze industry placement before committing to a map

**Ship Start Strategy (1850):**
- Ships have very low infrastructure cost
- Look for a route where one ship can carry all products at a profit with few empty legs
- Ideal route: grain farm near water → food processing plant near water → town
- Ship picks up grain, delivers to food plant, picks up bread/food, delivers to town
- One ship can handle multiple cargo types using auto-refit

**Key Tactics:**
- Build truck station OUTSIDE town to avoid traffic congestion
- Set truck lines to "full load, wait unlimited" so trucks don't create empty traffic
- Build ship dock near industries with water access
- Ship route: Farm dock → Food plant dock → Town dock (triangle loop)
- Ship picks up grain at farm, drops at food plant, picks up food at food plant, drops at town
- Revenue comes from town delivery of FOOD
- One ship line can be profitable from the very start in 1850

**Truck Feeder Lines:**
- Short truck routes from ship dock to town center for final-mile delivery
- Keep truck routes very short (within town)
- Full load wait at ship dock, load if available at town stops

**Financial Tips:**
- Pay off loans early
- Don't overbuild - one ship line is enough to start
- Let the food processing plant level up naturally (don't force it)
- Ship route generates enough income to fund expansion to trains (Part 2)
