### Summary of Key Strategies:

**Core Concept: Cargo Hubs**
- Most efficient way to handle cargo in TF2
- A cargo hub is a centralized sorting/transfer station where all cargo flows through
- Makes cities grow to absolute maximum size
- Can generate $200+ million per train line

**Why Cargo Hubs Work:**
- The game's "director" distributes cargo intelligently when using hubs
- Instead of direct industry-to-industry connections, route everything through a central hub
- Allows the game to share cargo amongst different industries simultaneously
- Trains carry mixed cargo (crude oil + coal + goods on same train)
- Empty cars on outbound trip get filled on return trip

**Hub Design - The Sorting Yard:**
- 6-track station minimum for the main hub
- Separate stations for: incoming raw materials, outgoing finished goods, local distribution
- Place hub BETWEEN industry clusters and towns
- Hub acts as a buffer/stockpile - cargo builds up then gets distributed efficiently

**Three Types of Lines at a Hub:**
1. **Feeder lines**: Bring raw materials TO the hub (from mines, farms, forests)
2. **Processing lines**: Move cargo FROM hub to processors and back (refineries, factories)
3. **Distribution lines**: Deliver finished goods FROM hub to towns

**Capacity vs Frequency:**
- For CARGO: capacity is king, NOT frequency and NOT speed
- Use the biggest trains possible for cargo
- Use long trains with many wagons
- One high-capacity train > many small trains
- This is opposite to passenger transport where frequency matters

**Local Distribution (Last Mile):**
- Use secondary train stations near towns for bulk transfer
- Use small capacity TRUCKS for final delivery INTO the city
- Never run cargo trains inside city zones
- Trucks for city delivery should be small capacity
- Keep delivery trucks separate from cargo trains

**Station Placement:**
- Cargo hub should be placed at a central location on the map
- Processing industries should be clustered near the hub
- Use "walking distance" feature - industries within ~500m of a station will auto-connect
- Place cargo stations at city BORDER, not city center

**Truck Delivery to Cities:**
- Build cargo truck station at city border
- Run small trucks from station into city commercial areas
- Trucks should deliver ALL cargo types the city demands
- Don't mix passenger and cargo truck routes
- Keep truck routes SHORT (within city only)

**Scaling the System:**
- Start with one hub, expand to 2-4 hubs for large maps
- Connect hubs with high-capacity inter-hub trains
- Each hub serves a REGION of the map
- New industries just need a feeder line to nearest hub

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Don't build direct industry-to-town routes for everything
- Don't use trucks for long-distance cargo
- Don't mix cargo and passenger trains
- Don't put cargo stations in city center (causes traffic)
- Don't use too many small vehicles when one big train works better
- Don't forget to deliver ALL demanded cargo types to cities

**Key Numbers:**
- 6-track minimum for hub stations
- ~500m walking distance for industry auto-connection
- Use the biggest trains available in current era
- Truck stations at city border with short routes in
- One hub per region, connect regions with inter-hub trains
